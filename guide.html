    <h2>1. Downloading Godot and Creating Your Project</h2>
    <p>Godot is a free, open source game engine that you will be using to make your game. It is very easy to learn as a beginner! First, go to <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">godotengine.org</a> and download it on your computer.</p>
    <img src="art/godotdownload.gif"/>
    <p>Click the Create New Project Button, and name your platformer. Then create a new folder that will have all your future Godot games. Use the Mobile renderer. Finally, click Create at the bottom.</p>

    <h2>2. Create Your Scene</h2>
    <p>In Scene section in the top left, you will see the options to create a root node, which is the starting point for your section. All the other components will be in the main Node. Godot can be used to make 2D games and 3D games. Choose Other Node and select Node. </p>

    <p>Then save the scene, and call it main.tscn. You will see it show up in the FileSystem below the Scene area. Later in your project, you will use this area to find different scenes, scripts, and assets.</p>
    <h2>3. Creating Your Character</h2>
    <p>At the top bar, change to 2D view instead of 3D view. The purple-outlined rectangle near the center is the view of the game. Click ctrl-A or use the plus button to create a new node, CharacterBody2D.</p>

    <p>Sprite2D is a node that displays textures (images). Create a Sprite2D node under Player. On the right bar, you will see the Texture and that it is empty. In the FileSystem, there is icon.svg of the Godot logo. Drag it to the texture box. Then you can resize it however you want. </p>

    <h2>4. Create a Collision Box</h2>
    <p>Add a CollisionShape2D to the Player. Then select Rectangle for the shape in the Inspector on the right. Resize the blue box to cover the player. This will help with the physics when the player is jumping and walking around. </p>
